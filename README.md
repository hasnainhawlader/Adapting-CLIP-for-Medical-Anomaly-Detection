#A-VLM-AD-Baseline: Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection for Brain MRI using CLIP

This project implements a baseline approach for Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection on a Brain MRI dataset using the pre-trained CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) visual encoder. The method relies on extracting deep, generalized features from the images, calculating a "normal" reference vector, and classifying test images based on their Cosine Distance to this reference.
